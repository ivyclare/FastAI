2. **Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.**

    - <span style="color:red"> Computer Vision e.g Object Detection </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> Natural Language processng e.g Machine Translation </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> Recommender Systems like on Netflix and YouTube </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> Medicine e.g diagnosing diabetic retinopathy </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> Time series prediction e.g Stock market prediction </span>

3. **What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?**

      <span style="color:red"> The **Mark I Perceptron** developed by Rosenblat </span>

4. **Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for "Parallel Distributed Processing"?**
    - <span style="color:red">A set of processing units  </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> A state of activation  </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> An output function for each unit  </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> A pattern of connectivity among units  </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities  </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce a new level of activation for the unit  </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience  </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> An environment within which the system must operate  </span>

5. **What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?**

      <span style="color:red"> That neural networks were too big and slow to be useful pratically  </span>

6. **What is a GPU?**
      <span style="color:red"> Stands for **Graphical Processing Unit**. It is a kind of processor that can run multiple calculations at a time </span>

7. **Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: `1+1`. What happens?**
      <span style="color:red"> 2 is printed </span>

1. What is segmentation?
1. What is `y_range` used for? When do we need it?
1. What are "hyperparameters"?
1. What's the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?
